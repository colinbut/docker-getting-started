# Getting Started with Docker

This mini project explores what it takes to get started in using Docker.

## Download

To download go to Docker website and hit the big download buttons for your operating system platform.
I use Mac OSX so i downloaded __Docker for Mac__. 
It used to be __Docker Toolbox__ where it used __VirtualBox__ to manage linux VMs.
And before that, some years ago now, it used to be __Boot2Docker__.

Note that if you've previously had Docker Toolbox then it can co-live with the new __Docker for Mac__
__Docker for Mac__ is very simple and very intuitive to use. Everything need to know is on the Docker website.


## Installation

Pretty straight forward in just following the docker guides on installation. For __Docker for Mac__ just double click the .dmg file and drag the Docker app to Applications folder.
